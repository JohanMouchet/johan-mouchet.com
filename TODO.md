## performance optimisation (Speedcurve):

- advocate for applications owners looking at their own definition of success...
- First Meaningful Paint: 2.15s > 2.25s (+??%) \* tooltip Less is better
  Note: a natural increase is expected with the growth of the code base year on year.
  As can be seen with these numbers, we slowed down the FMP trend
- Time To Interactive: 8.29s > 7.51s (-??%) \* tooltip Less is better
  and even reverted the TTI one.
- For the 15% it only concerns the size of our total bundle.

## Cheap flights

- pages conversion up +1.29% (3.29% -> 4.58%) FY20 YTD, YoY.. which has meant despite lower traffic, revenue is up +475k YoY (globally).

## advocated for
